# Topic-Models-use-for-Reddit-Communities-Detection 

Topic modeling and detecting trending events is a rising domain in the machine learning field during the last years. This is a complex research area which involves various different techniques and approaches to solve it. In this project a full pipeline is presented for topic modeling, topics comprehension, topic occurrences time series analysis and events detection. For topic modeling, comparison of wordbased-embedding with sentence-based-embedding methods is done and  a method is suggested to find the topics’ indicative words. An event-detector algorithm is proposed, which for a specific topic, takes as an input its total number of posts’ occurrences along the examined time-period, and outputs the dates in which the algorithm projects real-world events. Furthermore,  communities detection algorithm is tested to split and merge examined topics, which enables a better identification of the topics’ clusters. We apply our pipeline on three subreddits datasets on the 2020 U.S. Presidential elections period, and succeeded to find meaningful topics and detect real-world events using our event-detector algorithm, and show that using community detection algorithm improves the definition of the topics and as a result, the detected related events.
